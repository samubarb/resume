# My Resume

## `checkout` other branches
Currently in `master` branch you can find a general resume which isn't oriented to a specific job position. There are other versions of the resume, with relative branches named after them, for positions such as *backend* or *research*. Checkout them with 

```
$ cd resume
$ git checkout <branch-name>
```

To see all available branches simply run `$ git branch -r`.
